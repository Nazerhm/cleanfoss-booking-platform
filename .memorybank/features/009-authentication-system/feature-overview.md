# Feature: Authentication System

## üéØ Feature Goal
Implement a comprehensive authentication and authorization system using NextAuth.js to enable secure user sessions, role-based access control, and user management for the CleanFoss Booking Platform.

## üìã Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] NextAuth.js installed and configured with database adapter
- [ ] Email/password authentication provider implemented
- [ ] User registration and login flows working
- [ ] Role-based access control (Customer, Staff, Admin) implemented
- [ ] Session management with database persistence configured
- [ ] Protected API routes with authentication middleware
- [ ] User profile management interface created
- [ ] Authentication state integration with existing booking flow
- [ ] Security best practices implemented (password hashing, CSRF protection)
- [ ] Login/logout UI components integrated with existing design system

## ‚úÖ Definition of Done
- Authentication system is fully functional with secure login/logout
- User roles are properly enforced across all application areas
- Existing booking flow integrates seamlessly with authenticated users
- All API routes are properly protected with authentication middleware
- User interface provides clear authentication state feedback
- Password security follows industry best practices
- Session management is secure and performant
- Code is well-documented and follows project standards
- Authentication system is tested and validated

## üìù Context Notes
> Feature started: 2025-09-04

### Strategic Context
- **Foundation Priority**: Authentication is the security foundation for all user-facing features
- **Integration Ready**: Existing Prisma schema supports user management with multi-tenant architecture
- **Business Enablement**: Required for customer accounts, admin dashboards, and payment security
- **Technical Debt Prevention**: Early implementation avoids costly retrofitting to existing features

### Current System Integration Points
- **Database**: Enhanced Prisma client with connection resilience (Feature 008 complete)
- **Booking System**: Existing booking API ready for user association
- **UI Components**: Existing design system ready for authentication components
- **API Layer**: Route structure established for authentication middleware integration

### Task Breakdown Complete
‚úÖ **10 Tasks Created** - Comprehensive authentication system implementation plan:

1. **NextAuth.js Installation and Configuration** - Core authentication setup
2. **Email/Password Authentication Provider** - Secure credential authentication
3. **User Registration and Login UI Components** - User-friendly authentication interface
4. **Role-Based Access Control Implementation** - Comprehensive authorization system
5. **Protected API Routes and Middleware Integration** ‚úÖ - Secure API endpoint protection
6. **User Profile Management Interface** - User account and settings management
7. **Authentication State Integration with Booking Flow** - Seamless booking integration
8. **Security Implementation and Best Practices** - Enterprise-grade security measures
9. **Login/Logout UI Components and Navigation Integration** - Complete UI integration
10. **Authentication Testing and Documentation** - Comprehensive validation and docs

**Ready for implementation** following incremental development principles.
