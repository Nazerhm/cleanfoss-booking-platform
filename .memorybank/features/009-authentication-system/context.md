**Next Action**: ✅ **ACTIVE** - Implementing Task 1: NextAuth.js Installation and Configuration

## 🔧 Current Task Implementation
**Task 1 Objectives**:
- Install NextAuth.js and Prisma adapter packages
- Configure NextAuth.js with existing enhanced Prisma client
- Set up authentication API routes  
- Configure environment variables for secure authentication
- Test basic NextAuth.js integration with database

**Implementation Steps In Progress**:
1. 🔄 Package installation (next-auth, @next-auth/prisma-adapter)
2. ⏳ NextAuth configuration with Prisma adapter
3. ⏳ Environment variable setup
4. ⏳ API route creation
5. ⏳ Database integration testing

## 🎯 Feature Scope & Strategy

### Authentication Architecture
**Primary Components**:
1. **NextAuth.js Configuration**: Database adapter, providers, callbacks
2. **User Management**: Registration, login, profile management
3. **Role-Based Access**: Customer, Staff, Admin role enforcement
4. **Session Security**: Secure session management with database persistence
5. **API Protection**: Middleware for protected routes
6. **UI Integration**: Login/logout components with existing design system

### Integration Strategy
**Leverage Existing Infrastructure**:
- ✅ **Database**: Enhanced Prisma client with connection resilience
- ✅ **Schema**: Multi-tenant architecture supports user roles
- ✅ **API Layer**: Route structure ready for authentication middleware
- ✅ **UI System**: Design components ready for auth integration

### Business Value Delivery
**Immediate Capabilities**:
- Secure customer account creation and management
- Staff/admin access for service and booking management
- Foundation for personalized booking experiences
- Security compliance for payment processing

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Authentication
- NextAuth.js installation and database adapter configuration
- Email/password authentication provider
- User registration and login flows
- Basic session management

### Phase 2: Authorization & Roles
- Role-based access control implementation
- Protected API routes with middleware
- User role assignment and enforcement
- Permission-based UI rendering

### Phase 3: Integration & Security
