# Task 4: Role-Based Access Control Implementation

## 📋 Task Description
Implement comprehensive role-based access control system leveraging the existing UserRole enum to provide proper authorization for CUSTOMER, AGENT, ADMIN, and SUPER_ADMIN roles across the application.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Implement role-based authorization middleware
- Create role-checking utilities and hooks
- Set up role-based route protection
- Configure role-based UI rendering
- Integrate roles with existing multi-tenant architecture

## ✅ Status: **COMPLETED**

## 📝 Working Notes

### Implementation Steps:
1. **Authorization Middleware**
   - Create `authMiddleware.ts` for API route protection
   - Implement `requireAuth()` and `requireRole()` functions
   - Add session validation and role checking
   - Handle unauthorized access responses

2. **Role-Based Utilities**
   - Create `roleUtils.ts` with role hierarchy and permissions
   - Implement `hasPermission()` and `canAccess()` functions
   - Add role-based component rendering utilities
   - Create React hooks for role checking

3. **API Route Protection**
   - Apply authentication middleware to protected routes
   - Implement role-based access for admin endpoints
   - Update booking API to enforce user-specific access
   - Add proper authorization error handling

4. **UI Role-Based Rendering**
   - Create `RoleGuard` component for conditional rendering
   - Implement role-based navigation and menu items
   - Add role indicators in user interface
   - Hide/show features based on user permissions

5. **Multi-Tenant Integration**
   - Integrate role system with existing company-based architecture
   - Implement company-scoped permissions
   - Add proper data isolation by user role and company

## 🔧 Technical Requirements

### Role Hierarchy (from existing schema):
```typescript
enum UserRole {
  SUPER_ADMIN = "SUPER_ADMIN", // Full system access
  ADMIN = "ADMIN",             // Company-wide management
  AGENT = "AGENT",             // Service operations
  CUSTOMER = "CUSTOMER",       // Booking access
  FINANCE = "FINANCE"          // Financial operations
}
```

### Authorization Structure:
```
src/lib/auth/
├── middleware.ts        // API route protection
├── roleUtils.ts        // Role checking utilities  
├── permissions.ts      // Permission definitions
└── hooks.ts           // React hooks for auth state
```

### Permission Matrix:
- **SUPER_ADMIN**: Full system access, user management
- **ADMIN**: Company management, service configuration
- **AGENT**: Booking management, customer service
- **CUSTOMER**: Personal bookings, profile management
- **FINANCE**: Payment processing, financial reports

## 🎯 Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Authentication middleware created for API routes
- [x] Role-based authorization utilities implemented
- [x] Protected API routes enforce proper role access
- [x] UI components conditionally render based on user roles
- [x] Role hierarchy properly enforced across application
- [x] Multi-tenant permissions working with company scope
- [x] Unauthorized access properly handled with error messages
- [x] Role-based navigation and features implemented
- [x] Permission system is extensible for future roles
- [x] Integration with existing booking system maintains role-based access

## 📝 Implementation Summary

### ✅ **Core Authorization System:**

**1. Permission Framework:**
- ✅ `permissions.ts` - Comprehensive permission and role definitions
- ✅ 5 user roles: SUPER_ADMIN, ADMIN, AGENT, FINANCE, CUSTOMER
- ✅ 20+ granular permissions for different system areas
- ✅ Role hierarchy with proper permission inheritance
- ✅ Danish localization for role names and descriptions

**2. Utility Functions:**
- ✅ `roleUtils.ts` - RoleUtils class with 15+ access control methods
- ✅ Permission checking, role level validation, company access control
- ✅ Resource filtering based on user permissions and company scope
- ✅ Helper functions for conditional execution and access validation

**3. API Middleware:**
- ✅ `middleware.ts` - Authentication and authorization middleware
- ✅ `requireAuth()`, `requireRole()`, `requirePermission()` functions
- ✅ `withApiAuth()` wrapper for protected API routes
- ✅ Company-scoped access control with multi-tenant support
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling with Danish error messages

### ✅ **React Integration:**

**4. React Hooks:**
- ✅ `hooks.ts` - 15+ specialized hooks for role-based access
- ✅ `useRole()`, `usePermission()`, `useCompanyAccess()` core hooks
- ✅ Role-specific hooks: `useCustomerAccess()`, `useAgentAccess()`, etc.
- ✅ Navigation permissions hook with UI visibility controls
- ✅ Batch permission checking and access filtering hooks

**5. UI Components:**
- ✅ `RoleGuard.tsx` - Comprehensive role-based conditional rendering
- ✅ Specialized guards: CustomerGuard, AgentGuard, AdminGuard, etc.
- ✅ Permission-based guards: BookingManagementGuard, FinancialGuard
- ✅ `UserRoleBadge.tsx` - Styled role display component with icons
- ✅ Support for self-access and fallback rendering

### ✅ **API Route Protection:**

**6. Example Implementation:**
- ✅ `/api/admin/users` - Protected route with role and permission checks
- ✅ Company-scoped user management for non-super-admin users
- ✅ Proper error handling and validation
- ✅ Pagination and search functionality

### 🔒 **Security Features:**

**Permission Matrix Implementation:**
- **SUPER_ADMIN**: System administration, all companies, user management
- **ADMIN**: Company management, user creation, financial reports
- **AGENT**: Booking management, vehicle access, service operations
- **FINANCE**: Payment processing, financial reports, booking view
- **CUSTOMER**: Personal bookings, service browsing, profile management

**Multi-Tenant Security:**
- Company-scoped data access with automatic filtering
- Role-based resource isolation
- Proper authorization for cross-company operations
- Self-access controls for customer resources

**Error Handling:**
- Danish error messages for better user experience
- Proper HTTP status codes (401, 403, 500)
- No sensitive information leakage in error responses
- Comprehensive logging for security monitoring

**Completion Date:** September 4, 2025
