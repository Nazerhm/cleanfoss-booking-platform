## üéØ Feature: Authentication System
> Comprehensive authentication and authorization implementation

## üìù Decisions Log

| Date (YYYY-MM-DD) | Context / Question | Decision | Status |
|-------------------|--------------------|----------|--------|
| 2025-09-04 | Authentication library selection for Next.js integration | NextAuth.js - industry standard with excellent Next.js integration, database adapter support, and comprehensive security features | ‚úÖ Decided |
| 2025-09-04 | Authentication strategy for user types | Email/password authentication as primary method - simple, secure, widely accepted by users | ‚úÖ Decided |
| 2025-09-04 | Role-based access control model | Three-tier role system: Customer (booking access), Staff (service management), Admin (full system access) | ‚úÖ Decided |
| 2025-09-04 | Session management approach | Database session persistence using NextAuth.js database adapter with existing Prisma client for consistency and reliability | ‚úÖ Decided |
| 2025-09-04 | Feature development sequence priority | Authentication system as next feature following database infrastructure completion - security foundation approach | ‚úÖ Decided |

## üîß Technical Decisions

### Authentication Architecture
**NextAuth.js Configuration**:
- Database adapter integration with existing Prisma schema
- Secure session management with database persistence
- CSRF protection and security best practices built-in

### User Role Management
**Role Hierarchy**:
```
Admin: Full system access (user management, system configuration)
Staff: Service management (bookings, services, operational tasks)  
Customer: Booking access (create bookings, view history, profile)
```

### Integration Strategy
**Leverage Existing Infrastructure**:
- Enhanced Prisma client for database operations
- Existing API route structure for authentication endpoints
- Current UI component system for authentication interface
- Multi-tenant database schema for role-based data access

## üéØ Implementation Approach

### Incremental Development Strategy
Following .github principles with small, testable increments:
1. **Core Setup**: NextAuth.js installation and basic configuration
2. **User Management**: Registration and login functionality  
3. **Role Implementation**: Role-based access control
4. **API Protection**: Authentication middleware for routes
5. **UI Integration**: Authentication components and state management
6. **Security Enhancement**: Advanced security features and validation

### Quality Assurance
- Comprehensive testing of authentication flows
- Security validation and penetration testing considerations
- Integration testing with existing booking system
- User experience validation for authentication workflows
