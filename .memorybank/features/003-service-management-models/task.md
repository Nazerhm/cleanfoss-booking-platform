# Task 003: Service Management Models

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Estimated Time**: 4-6 hours  
**Actual Time**: 4 hours  

## Context
Building on the validated multi-tenant foundation from Tasks 001-002, we need to implement service management models to handle the core business logic for car cleaning services.

## Objective
Create comprehensive service management models that support:
- Service categorization and organization
- Individual services with pricing and duration
- Service extras/add-ons tied to specific services
- Service bundles with discounted pricing
- Multi-tenant isolation for all service-related data

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Category Model ✅
- **Purpose**: Organize services into logical groups (Exterior, Interior, Premium, etc.)
- **Fields**: id, name, description, image, slug, status, companyId, timestamps
- **Relationships**: belongs to Company, has many Services
- **Constraints**: Unique slug per company

### 2. Service Model ✅
- **Purpose**: Core service offerings with pricing and duration
- **Fields**: id, name, description, price, deposit, duration, image, backgroundColor, status, minCapacity, maxCapacity, companyId, categoryId, timestamps
- **Relationships**: belongs to Company and Category, has many ServiceExtras, many-to-many with Bundles through BundleService
- **Business Logic**: Support for group bookings, pricing flexibility

### 3. ServiceExtra Model ✅
- **Purpose**: Add-on services tied to specific base services
- **Fields**: id, name, description, price, duration, maxQuantity, image, status, companyId, serviceId, timestamps
- **Relationships**: belongs to Company and Service
- **Business Logic**: Tied to specific services (not global extras)

### 4. Bundle Model ✅
- **Purpose**: Package multiple services together with discounted pricing
- **Fields**: id, name, description, price, deposit, status, companyId, timestamps
- **Relationships**: belongs to Company, many-to-many with Services through BundleService
- **Business Logic**: Discounted pricing compared to individual service pricing

### 5. BundleService Model ✅
- **Purpose**: Junction table for Bundle-Service many-to-many relationship
- **Fields**: id, bundleId, serviceId, quantity, timestamps
- **Relationships**: belongs to Bundle and Service
- **Constraints**: Unique combination of bundleId and serviceId

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Database Schema ✅
- [x] Add Category model with multi-tenant support
- [x] Add Service model with pricing and capacity settings
- [x] Add ServiceExtra model tied to specific services
- [x] Add Bundle model for service packages
- [x] Add BundleService junction table
- [x] Update Company model with new relationships
- [x] Create and run database migration

### Phase 2: Model Validation ✅
- [x] Create comprehensive test suite
- [x] Test Category creation and relationships
- [x] Test Service creation with categories and extras
- [x] Test Bundle creation with multiple services
- [x] Test multi-tenant data isolation
- [x] Validate pricing calculations and discounts
- [x] Test foreign key constraints and cascading

## Validation Results ✅

### Test Coverage
- ✅ **License and Company Creation**: Multi-tenant foundation working
- ✅ **Category Management**: 3 categories created with proper company isolation
- ✅ **Service Management**: 3 services created across different categories
- ✅ **Service Extras**: 3 extras created and tied to appropriate services
- ✅ **Bundle Creation**: 2 bundles created with service combinations
- ✅ **Relationship Validation**: All foreign keys and relationships working
- ✅ **Pricing Logic**: Bundle discounts calculated correctly (14% savings validated)
- ✅ **Multi-tenant Isolation**: Company 1 has 3 services, Company 2 has 0 services
- ✅ **Database Constraints**: Foreign key constraints properly enforced

### Key Findings
1. **Service-Extra Relationship**: ServiceExtra requires serviceId (tied to specific services, not global)
2. **Bundle Structure**: Uses BundleService junction table for many-to-many relationship
3. **Pricing Model**: Services have `price` field, bundles offer discounted total pricing
4. **Multi-tenant Isolation**: All models properly isolated by companyId
5. **Database Migration**: Clean migration with no conflicts

## Files Created/Modified

### Database Schema
- `prisma/schema.prisma`: Added Category, Service, ServiceExtra, Bundle, BundleService models
- `prisma/migrations/20250902165340_add_service_management_models/`: New migration

### Test Infrastructure
- `src/lib/test-service-management.ts`: Comprehensive test suite with 7 validation phases

### Updated Models

## Next Steps
- **Task 004**: Car Management Models (brands, models, pricing rules)
- **Task 005**: Booking Engine with availability checking
- **Task 006**: Payment processing integration

## Success Criteria ✅
- [x] All service management models created and migrated
- [x] Multi-tenant isolation verified for all models
- [x] Service categorization working correctly
- [x] Service extras properly tied to base services
- [x] Bundle pricing and service combinations validated
- [x] Foreign key relationships and constraints working
- [x] Comprehensive test coverage with 100% pass rate

**Task Completed**: September 2, 2025  
**Validation**: All tests passing, models ready for booking system integration
