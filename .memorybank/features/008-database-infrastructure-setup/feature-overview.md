# Feature: Database Infrastructure Setup

## üéØ Feature Goal
Establish a stable, reliable PostgreSQL database infrastructure for development and production environments, ensuring consistent database connectivity and eliminating intermittent connection failures in the booking system.

## üìã Acceptance Criteria
- [x] PostgreSQL server runs consistently on localhost:5432
- [x] Database connection is stable across application restarts
- [x] Environment variables are standardized and documented
- [x] Database service can be easily started/stopped for development
- [x] Connection pooling and retry logic implemented
- [x] All existing Prisma migrations work reliably
- [x] Booking creation API successfully persists data to database
## üìã Acceptance Criteria
- [x] PostgreSQL server installed and configured on development environment
- [x] Database connection established with proper credentials and configuration
- [x] Database schema deployed and synchronized with application models
- [x] Basic CRUD operations tested and confirmed working
- [x] Connection pooling and performance optimization implemented
- [x] Error handling and connection resilience implemented
- [x] End-to-end booking workflow validated with database persistence
- [x] Database setup documented for new developers

## ‚úÖ Definition of Done
- PostgreSQL service configuration documented and automated
- Environment files (.env*) standardized with clear hierarchy
- Database connection resilience implemented in Prisma client
- Development workflow documented with start/stop procedures
- All booking flows successfully save to database without errors
- Infrastructure setup is reproducible on fresh development environments
- Connection monitoring and error handling implemented

## üìù Context Notes
> Feature started: 2025-09-04

### Current Situation Analysis
- **Existing Infrastructure**: PostgreSQL database with correct credentials exists
- **Schema Status**: Complete Prisma schema with all models implemented
- **Migration Status**: Migrations successfully run with `npx prisma db push`
- **Problem**: Intermittent "Can't reach database server at localhost:5432" errors
- **Root Cause**: PostgreSQL service not consistently running or accessible

### Environment Configuration Issues
- Multiple .env files with conflicting database URLs
- .env.local overrides working .env configuration
- Inconsistent database credentials across environment files

### 2025-09-04
- Initial analysis shows PostgreSQL intermittently accessible
- Booking API attempts database operations but fails on connection
- Need systematic infrastructure audit and stabilization

## üîç Decisions Log
| Date (YYYY-MM-DD) | Context / Question | Decision | Status |
|-------------------|--------------------|----------|--------|
| 2025-09-04 | Multiple .env files causing credential conflicts | Standardize environment hierarchy and consolidate database URL | Pending |
| 2025-09-04 | PostgreSQL service stability | Implement service monitoring and auto-restart procedures | Pending |

## üìù Scratch Notes
- Existing working database URL: `postgresql://cleanfoss_user:cleanfoss_password@localhost:5432/cleanfoss_db`
- Prisma client shows pool initialization success then connection failures
- Need to investigate Windows PostgreSQL service status and configuration
