# Task 3: Database Connection Testing

## üéØ Task Objective
Test and verify database connectivity between the CleanFoss booking application and the running PostgreSQL server to ensure proper integration.

## üìã Task Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] PostgreSQL server responds to connection attempts
- [ ] Project database `cleanfoss_db` exists or can be created
- [ ] Project user `cleanfoss_user` exists with proper permissions
- [ ] Application can connect using environment credentials
- [ ] Prisma client can connect and query the database
- [ ] `npx prisma db push` completes successfully
- [ ] Basic database operations work (create, read, update, delete)

## üîß Testing Steps

### Step 1: Test PostgreSQL Connectivity
- Use `psql` command-line tool to test basic connectivity
- Verify superuser (postgres) connection works
- Check if project database and user already exist

### Step 2: Create Project Database and User
- Create `cleanfoss_db` database if it doesn't exist
- Create `cleanfoss_user` with appropriate permissions
- Grant necessary privileges for application operations

### Step 3: Test Application Credentials
- Test connection using environment variables from .env.local
- Verify DATABASE_URL format and accessibility
- Confirm authentication works with project credentials

### Step 4: Prisma Integration Testing
- Run `npx prisma db push` to test schema deployment
- Verify Prisma client can generate and connect
- Test basic database operations through Prisma

### Step 5: Application Integration
- Test database connection from within the Next.js application
- Verify booking API can access database
- Confirm multi-tenant schema works correctly

## üìù Working Notes
*Connection testing progress and findings will be captured here*

### Current Environment Configuration
- **DATABASE_URL**: `postgresql://cleanfoss_user:cleanfoss_password@localhost:5432/cleanfoss_db`
- **Server**: localhost:5432 (verified running)
- **Expected Database**: cleanfoss_db
- **Expected User**: cleanfoss_user
- **Password**: cleanfoss_password

### PostgreSQL Connection Commands
```bash
# Test superuser connection
psql -U postgres -h localhost

# Test project user connection (once created)
psql -U cleanfoss_user -d cleanfoss_db -h localhost

# Test via Prisma
npx prisma db push
npx prisma studio
```

## ‚úÖ Validation Criteria
- All connection tests pass without errors
- Prisma schema deploys successfully to database
- Application can perform CRUD operations
- Multi-tenant booking system database integration works
- No authentication or permission errors

**Dependencies**: Task 2 Complete (PostgreSQL installed and running)
**Next Task**: Application Integration Testing
