# Task 1: Database Service Audit

## üéØ Task Objective
Diagnose PostgreSQL service status and configuration to understand why database connections are intermittently failing.

## üìã Task Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] PostgreSQL service status determined (running/stopped/not installed)
- [ ] Port 5432 accessibility verified
- [ ] Database server configuration analyzed
- [ ] Connection pathway tested outside application context
- [ ] Root cause of connection failures identified

## üîç Investigation Steps

### Step 1: PostgreSQL Service Discovery
- Check Windows services for PostgreSQL installations
- Identify PostgreSQL version and installation path
- Verify service startup configuration

### Step 2: Port and Network Analysis
- Test port 5432 accessibility
- Check for conflicting services on port 5432
- Verify localhost resolution

### Step 3: Direct Database Connection Test
- Attempt connection using psql or database client
- Test connection string outside of application
- Validate credentials and database existence

### Step 4: Service Configuration Review
- Check PostgreSQL configuration files
- Verify listen_addresses and port settings
- Review authentication configuration (pg_hba.conf)

## üìù Working Notes
*Real-time investigation findings will be captured here*

### Investigation Results - COMPLETE
- **PostgreSQL Windows Service**: ‚ùå Not found (`Get-Service *postgres*` returned no results)
- **PostgreSQL Client Tools**: ‚ùå Not installed (`psql` command not found)
- **Port 5432 Listener**: ‚ùå Nothing listening on port 5432
- **Docker Containers**: ‚ùå Docker Desktop not running/installed
- **Prisma Connectivity Test**: ‚ùå Confirms "Can't reach database server at localhost:5432"
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED - PostgreSQL is NOT installed or running**

### Critical Finding
**The database infrastructure does not exist on this system.** The application is configured to connect to PostgreSQL at `localhost:5432`, but no PostgreSQL server is installed or running.

### Previous Success Mystery Resolved
Previous `npx prisma db push` success likely occurred either:
1. On a different development environment with PostgreSQL installed
2. When a temporary PostgreSQL instance was running
3. The success was misremembered or occurred in a different context

### Task 1 Status: ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Next Required Action**: Install and configure PostgreSQL server or choose alternative database solution.

## ‚úÖ Validation Criteria
- PostgreSQL service status clearly determined
- Connection pathway issues identified and documented
- Clear understanding of infrastructure state
- Actionable findings for next task

**Dependencies**: None
**Next Task**: Environment Configuration Standardization
