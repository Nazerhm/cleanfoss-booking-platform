## üìù Implementation Notes
> Task started: 2025-09-04

### Current Infrastructure Achievements
- ‚úÖ PostgreSQL 17 server: Stable installation on localhost:5432
- ‚úÖ Database setup: `cleanfoss_db` with `cleanfoss_user` properly configured
- ‚úÖ Enhanced Prisma client: Connection pooling (21 connections) + retry logic
- ‚úÖ Connection resilience: Exponential backoff, smart error classification
- ‚úÖ End-to-end validation: Complete booking workflow confirmed working
- ‚úÖ Production readiness: All database operations stable and efficient

### Documentation Scope
Following incremental development principles:
1. **PostgreSQL Setup Guide**: Complete installation and configuration steps
2. **Database Configuration**: User creation, permissions, environment setup
3. **Enhanced Prisma Features**: Connection pooling, retry logic, error handling
4. **Troubleshooting Guide**: Common issues and solutions
5. **Developer Onboarding**: Checklist for new team members
6. **Integration Documentation**: How booking system uses the infrastructure

## üîß Technical Details
- Update `/docs/database-setup.md` with complete setup process
- Enhance project README with database requirements
- Document environment variables and their hierarchy
- Provide examples of using enhanced Prisma client features
- Include troubleshooting for connection issues and common errors
