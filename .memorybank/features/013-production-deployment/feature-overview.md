# Feature: Production Deployment Readiness

## 🎯 Feature Goal
Transform the 90%-complete CleanFoss Booking Platform from development state to production-ready deployment by resolving runtime issues, optimizing performance, and implementing production-grade configurations.

## 📋 Acceptance Criteria
- [x] All runtime/prerendering errors resolved (profile page, API routes)
- [x] Next.js static generation optimized for production deployment
- [x] Environment configurations properly set up for production
- [x] Database connection pooling and optimization for production load
- [x] Proper error boundaries and logging for production monitoring
- [x] Security headers and production hardening implemented
- [x] Build process creates deployable artifacts without errors
- [x] Performance optimizations applied (caching, compression, etc.)

## ✅ Definition of Done
- [x] Clean production build with no deployment blockers
- [x] All pages render properly in production environment
- [x] API routes handle production traffic correctly
- [x] Database configured for production workloads
- [x] Monitoring and error tracking implemented
- [x] Security configurations production-ready
- [x] Documentation for deployment procedures
- [x] Performance meets production standards
