# Task 1: Runtime Error Resolution - Critical Deployment Blockers

## 🎯 Task Goal
Fix immediate runtime errors that are preventing successful production deployment, including profile page prerendering issues and API route dynamic server usage warnings.

## 📋 Task Objectives
1. **Profile Page SSR Fix**: Resolve NextAuth `useSession()` undefined destructuring during prerendering
2. **API Routes Dynamic Usage**: Fix dynamic server usage warnings in car-brands and services APIs  
3. **Authentication Middleware**: Resolve header access conflicts with static generation
4. **Build Process**: Ensure clean production build with no deployment blockers

## 🔍 Validation Steps
- ✅ Profile page renders without prerendering errors
- ✅ Build completes without dynamic server usage warnings  
- ✅ All pages load correctly in production mode
- ✅ API routes function properly while allowing static optimization
- ✅ Authentication middleware works without SSR conflicts

## 📝 Working Notes

### 2025-09-05 - Task Started

**Current Issues Identified:**
1. **Profile Page Error**: `TypeError: Cannot destructure property 'data' of 's(...).useSession(...)' as it is undefined.`
2. **API Routes**: `Dynamic server usage: Page couldn't be rendered statically because it used request.url`
3. **Auth Middleware**: `Dynamic server usage: Page couldn't be rendered statically because it used headers`

**Solution Strategy:**
- Start with Profile page - add client-side guards
- Fix API routes - remove unnecessary request.url usage
- Configure middleware for proper static/dynamic handling

### 2025-09-05 - MAJOR PROGRESS ✅

**Fixed Issues:**
1. ✅ **Profile Page**: Added `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` in `/profile/layout.tsx`
2. ✅ **API Routes**: Added `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` to car-brands and services routes
3. ✅ **Search Params**: Changed from `request.url` to `request.nextUrl.searchParams`
4. ✅ **Build Process**: **Build now completes successfully** with exit code 0!

**Key Achievements:**
- **Profile page** now marked as λ (Dynamic) instead of causing prerendering errors
- **API routes** properly configured for dynamic rendering
- **Build success**: All static pages generated successfully (34/34)
- **No deployment blockers**: Build process completes without errors

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Build completes successfully 
- ✅ Static generation working for appropriate pages
- ✅ Dynamic pages properly configured
- ⚠️ Still have middleware warnings but they don't prevent deployment

## ✅ Completion Criteria
- Clean production build (exit code 0)
- No prerendering errors in build output
- All critical pages render successfully
- API endpoints maintain functionality while enabling optimization
