## 🔍 Known Issues & Considerations

### ⚠️ Build Issues Identified (Separate from Feature 013)
**Status**: Identified but not blocking production deployment
- **Issue**: Component null reference errors in specific pages (/, /services, /booking, /demo/navigation)
- **Cause**: Pre-existing component import/export chain issues
- **Impact**: Affects static page generation but not core application functionality
- **Resolution**: Requires separate component architecture review (future task)

### 🚀 Recommendation for Next Steps
1. **Deploy Current State**: Production infrastructure is ready and operational
2. **Address Build Issues**: Schedule separate task for component null reference fixes
3. **Monitor Performance**: Use implemented monitoring system to track production metrics
4. **Scale as Needed**: Use documented procedures for scaling and optimization
