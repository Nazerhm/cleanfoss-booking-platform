## ðŸŽ¯ Strategic Context

**Business Driver**: Platform at 90% completion needs to be deployable to capture immediate market opportunity.

**Technical Context**: Clean TypeScript compilation achieved, core functionality operational, deployment blocked by specific runtime issues.

**Risk Assessment**: Runtime issues are isolated and fixable vs. architectural problems requiring major refactoring.
