# Task 004: Car Management Models

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours  
**Actual Time**: 3 hours  

## Context
Building on the completed service management foundation (Task 003), we implemented car-specific models that enable CleanFoss's unique value proposition: dynamic pricing and service customization based on car characteristics.

## Objective ✅
Create comprehensive car management models that support:
- Car brand and model catalog management
- Vehicle type classification (sedan, SUV, hatchback, etc.)
- Dynamic pricing rules based on car characteristics
- Customer vehicle registration and selection
- Service pricing modifiers based on car size/type
- Multi-tenant isolation for company-specific pricing rules

## Technical Requirements

### 1. CarBrand Model ✅
- **Purpose**: Catalog of all car manufacturers
- **Fields**: id, name, slug, logo, status, sortOrder, companyId, timestamps
- **Relationships**: belongs to Company, has many CarModels and CustomerVehicles
- **Business Logic**: Company-specific brand catalogs for localized markets

### 2. CarModel Model ✅
- **Purpose**: Specific car models within each brand
- **Fields**: id, name, slug, brandId, vehicleType, vehicleSize, status, sortOrder, companyId, timestamps
- **Relationships**: belongs to Company and CarBrand, has many CustomerVehicles and ServicePricingRules
- **Business Logic**: Categorization for pricing and service selection

### 3. VehicleType Enum ✅
- **Values**: SEDAN, HATCHBACK, SUV, WAGON, COUPE, CONVERTIBLE, PICKUP, VAN, LUXURY
- **Purpose**: Standard categorization for pricing tiers

### 4. VehicleSize Enum ✅
- **Values**: SMALL, MEDIUM, LARGE, EXTRA_LARGE
- **Purpose**: Primary factor for service duration and pricing

### 5. CustomerVehicle Model ✅
- **Purpose**: Customer's registered vehicles for booking
- **Fields**: id, customerId, brandId, modelId, year, color, licensePlate, nickname, isDefault, status, companyId, timestamps
- **Relationships**: belongs to Company, User (customer), CarBrand, CarModel
- **Business Logic**: Customer can have multiple vehicles, one default for quick booking

### 6. ServicePricingRule Model ✅
- **Purpose**: Dynamic pricing based on vehicle characteristics
- **Fields**: id, serviceId, vehicleType, vehicleSize, modelId, priceModifier, durationModifier, description, isActive, companyId, timestamps
- **Relationships**: belongs to Company, Service, and optionally CarModel
- **Business Logic**: Percentage-based modifiers (e.g., SUV +25%, Small Car -15%)
