# Task 4: Code Refactoring & Optimization

## 📋 Task Objective
Refactor code for better performance, maintainability, and reusability while preserving all existing functionality.

## 🎯 Specific Goals
- Extract reusable functions and components
- Optimize component re-rendering
- Implement proper memoization strategies
- Consolidate duplicate code patterns
- Improve algorithm efficiency

## 🔍 Validation Steps
1. No duplicate code patterns exist
2. Components are properly memoized
3. State management is optimized
4. Performance metrics show improvement
5. Functionality remains unchanged

## 📝 Working Notes
*Focus on booking flow performance optimization*
*Authentication components may benefit from memoization*
*API route handlers could be consolidated*

## 📊 Progress Tracking
- [ ] Component extraction and reuse
- [ ] Performance optimization
