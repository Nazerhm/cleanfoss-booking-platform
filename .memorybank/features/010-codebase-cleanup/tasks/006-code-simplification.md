# Task 6: Code Simplification & Clarity

## 📋 Task Objective
Reduce code complexity and cognitive load by eliminating unnecessary abstractions and improving readability.

## 🎯 Specific Goals
- Simplify overly complex conditional logic
- Reduce nested structures and indentation
- Eliminate unnecessary abstractions
- Streamline function parameters and interfaces
- Improve variable and function naming

## 🔍 Validation Steps
1. Code complexity metrics show improvement
2. Functions have clear, single responsibilities
3. Conditional logic is straightforward
4. Abstractions serve clear purposes
5. Code reads naturally and clearly

## 📝 Working Notes
