## 🔍 Decisions Log
| Date (YYYY-MM-DD) | Context / Question | Decision | Status |
|-------------------|--------------------|----------|--------|
| 2025-09-05 | Cleanup approach methodology | Implement 7-stage systematic cleanup: doc → debloat → modernize → refactor → restructure → simplify → comment | ✅ Decided |
| 2025-09-05 | Task sequence optimization | Start with documentation to establish context, end with comments for maintainability | ✅ Decided |
| 2025-09-05 | Scope definition | Focus on src/ directory with selective cleanup of root configuration files | ✅ Decided |

## 📝 Scratch Notes
*Build error in BookingSummary.tsx indicates module resolution issues*
*Authentication system components need integration with existing booking flow*
*Performance optimization opportunities in component re-rendering*
