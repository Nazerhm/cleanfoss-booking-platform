# Feature 010: Codebase Cleanup - Context & Progress

## 🎯 Current Working Context
**Active Feature**: Codebase Cleanup & Production Optimization  
**Active Task**: Task 4 - Code Refactoring & Performance Optimization  
**Status**: Task 3 COMPLETED ✅ - Moving to refactoring phase  
**Focus**: Optimize performance, extract reusable patterns, improve code architecture

## 📋 Progress Summary
**Completed**: 
- ✅ Task 1 - Documentation Cleanup (MAJOR SUCCESS - Fixed critical build failure)
- ✅ Task 2 - Code Debloating (MAJOR SUCCESS - TypeScript compilation resolved)  
- ✅ Task 3 - Code Modernization (MAJOR SUCCESS - TypeScript patterns modernized)
**Current Stage**: Task 4 - Code Refactoring & Performance Optimization  
**Next Actions**: Extract reusable patterns, optimize performance, improve architecture

## 🔄 Development Flow
1. **Documentation Cleanup** - Establish comprehensive technical documentation
2. **Code Debloating** - Remove temporary artifacts and debug code
3. **Code Modernization** - Update to current TypeScript/React patterns
4. **Code Refactoring** - Optimize performance and reusability
5. **Code Restructuring** - Organize architecture and file structure
6. **Code Simplification** - Reduce complexity and improve clarity
7. **Code Documentation** - Add comprehensive inline documentation

## 📊 Task Dependencies
- Tasks 1-3: Can run independently (documentation, cleanup, modernization)
- Tasks 4-5: Sequential dependency (refactor before restructure)
- Tasks 6-7: Final stage (simplify then document)

## 🔍 Key Considerations
- **Build Errors**: BookingSummary.tsx compilation failures need resolution
- **Technical Debt**: Accumulated across 9 features, systematic cleanup required
- **Production Readiness**: Focus on maintainability and performance
- **Testing**: Maintain existing test coverage throughout cleanup

## 📝 Running Notes
